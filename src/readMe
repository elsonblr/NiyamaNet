Version 1
---------
1. Read files in a directory given, default
2. Mention the total count of files
3. Identify how many files to process
4. Maintain history of processed files - (Caching files for x days V2)
5. read the new files every time
6. Once the file is read, read the rows one at a time
7. take rules from rule file.
8. Apply rules on every row
9. print the output file

Version 2
---------
0. Write a startup class or processor which would invoke input, core & output interfaces.
1. Instead of history, application can alert the filename, date and sensitive data information.
2. Can keep a tempory cache of read files, not to duplicate the effort.
3. Instead of printing send output to a defined interface, big query, sms message, thir party system.
4. Input can be an interface, meaning it can be standalone app, webservice, lamda function etc
5. Core module will be same for all the interfaces
6. Core module should have support for log scanning, db scanning, REST data scanning


Version 3
---------
1. Provision to schedule the scans
2. Provision to identify the peak time and avoid scanning during high load.
3. Scan for IP address and domains

Search in database layer
------------------------



Search in the application layer
-------------------------------
Card/Debit card
    card number - 14 to 19 digits of standard associations. custom ranges also possible, example : Enable Search(Y/N), VISA(Type), 16(Length), LunsCheck(Y/N), Type(Numeral, AlphaNumeral, SpecialCharectors)
    name - Length(25), enable/disable
    cvv - Length, encryption
    expiry - DD/YY
    chip (dip machines) - few encrypted details
    magnetic strip (swipe based machines) - few encrypted details
    File extension - .txt, .log
    Data source path : file/ database/ aws / any source

    reading the line and finding for various checks or patterns.
    database : table & column level
    aws : log or any other storage mechanism, log stored in aws bucket,



Tap & Pay (NFC)
    merchant device, application(phone user), card from user
    limit for payment
    Security is bank's and merchants responsibilty

upi
    VPA - virtual private address

Type of applications to allow payments through which accepts above payment types.
    cloud based applications
    traditional applications - on primise
    Usually deployment is done through automated process or through putty with relevant tools.
    Softwares which i came across war deployment, jar deployment, micro service deployment using containers.

   Storage of logs is either through physical machines drives or to a remote service through http call for retriving it from the central location.

   log continous updates to a specific folder/directory,


Additional info
